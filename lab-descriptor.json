  "objective": "Intention of this lab is to provide exposure to the students and other users on the fundamental of digital electronics. The lab contents are chosen such that it covers the syllabi of the digital electronics course of various universities to considerable extent. By performing such virtual laboratories remotely, the user can repeat the experiments for better understanding and also learn at their own pace and according to their time of convenience. The learning management system developed for the experiments tries to provide a comprehensive coverage of different experiments covered under the laboratory.",
